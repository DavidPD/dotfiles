# Overview

A while ago I forked https://github.com/holman/dotfiles and for quite a while I've modified and built upon them quite successfully. But I admit there are some things I fantasize about doing differently, and so I've finally decided to start from a clean slate. This commit marks the beginning of that clean slate. Long live my dotfiles.

Eventually this readme will reflect something actually useful. For now it doesn't.
