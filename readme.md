# Changes

You can see the changes I'm making here: https://github.com/DavidPD/dotfiles/compare/master...NukeNPave

Many of the commit messages have long detailed explanations of what I'm thinking and planning. Perhaps someday I'll turn them into a blog post.

# Overview

A while ago I forked https://github.com/holman/dotfiles and for quite a while I've modified and built upon them quite successfully. But I admit there are some things I fantasize about doing differently, and so I've finally decided to start from a clean slate. This commit marks the beginning of that clean slate. My dotfiles are dead. Long live my dotfiles.

This branch is *_DEFINITELY_* not ready for anyone else to use, but eventually I picture this as being something others would be able to build upon for their own use. And so the cycle would continue.

## Todo

* Install heavily used software
    * Including cli software (oh-my-zsh)
* Set up configuration syncing for software:
    * Karabiner
    * Better Touch Tool
    * Keyboard Maestro
    * iTerm
    * Sublime Text
    * VSCode
* Set up default OSX settings
    * Screenshot location
    * Default shell (zsh)
* Figure out some way of storing licenses for paid software.
